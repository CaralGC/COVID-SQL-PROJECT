# COVID-SQL-Project

This is my first SQL project, where I analyze COVID data from 2020 to 2023. 
The data includes information by country, continent, date, number of people infected, deaths, people vaccinated, etc.

The project includes the use of BASIC concepts like ORDER BY, GROUP BY, CASE - WHEN - THEN - ELSE, SUM, TRY_CONVERT, etc. Also, it includes some other more advance concepts like JOIN, 
and some advance features like Common Table Expressions (CTE).

The visualization of the results can be found in another project made in Tableau in the following links:
